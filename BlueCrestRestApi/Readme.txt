There may be port clashes on your system so it might be necessary to change the ports when launching the BlueCrestrestApi service or the BlueCrestHomework web application.

The ports are set in launchSettings.json files of the respective services.

Apologies if I am teaching my granny how to sick eggs but you never know.
